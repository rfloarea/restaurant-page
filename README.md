## What I did
Used JavaScript and Webpack to dynamically render stuff.

## What I learned
1. Writing modules is so nice for my brain. Keeping these things separate feels like taking a huge breath. Like I can finally see everything that's going on in my code.
2. Webpack is so cool! Very, umm, how do you say, a lot? for a lil baby coder like me. But also, if I can basically learn how to use it in a day, it can't be that bad. But it's not like I'm a poweruser or anything. I'm just getting by. I have a functional level of skill with it. And even so, it's really great!
3. Just a reminder to my future self, again, MAKE SMALL COMMITS!!!

I got the basic functionality of this project down. And even on such a basic project, I can see how useful this way of working can be. I'm also starting to really like using JS. I'm really starting to get it. Mostly. Sometimes. Often. I don't know! haha I just know it's starting to feel mostly good and not mostly painful. So that's nice.

Also starting to really see how "web development" truely is an ecosystem of tools and techniques and strategies. I like that about it. There's so much opportunity for experimentation and learning.
